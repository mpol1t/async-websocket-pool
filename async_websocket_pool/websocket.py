    Asynchronously establishes a WebSocket connection to a given endpoint and continuously listens
    for incoming messages until a timeout or a disconnection occurs.

    This function initiates a connection to a specified WebSocket URL and invokes the provided
    message handler function for every message received. In case of a disconnection, it attempts
    to reestablish the connection using an exponential backoff strategy.

    The timeout parameter controls how long the function will wait for a message before the
    receive operation expires. If the timeout is set to None, the function will wait indefinitely
    for a message. If a timeout duration is specified, the function will wait for that period before
    timing out and attempting to reconnect.

    All exceptions, except for asyncio.TimeoutError and websockets.ConnectionClosed, are logged and
    propagated up the call stack.

    :param url: The WebSocket URL to establish the connection.
    :param message_handler: A callback function to handle incoming messages. This function should
                            accept a single argument which will be the received message.
    :param timeout: Optional; The maximum wait time for a message, in seconds. If set to None,
                    the function will wait indefinitely for a message.
    :param kwargs: Optional; Additional keyword arguments for the websockets.connect function to
                   further customize the WebSocket connection.
